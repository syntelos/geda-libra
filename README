TODO

    sym

        Fix new bug for symbol layout from pin label widths.  See
        test/sym/dst/ADXL345.sym.

    general

        Merge attribute subclass children of symbol and schematic into
        the attribute children list for uniformity under producer and
        consumer modes.

    sch

        Layout and markup "glue" nets.

        Fix pin iteration, see test/schematic..sch

        Differentiate symbols on having pins or not.  Symbols without pins are logo/graphics.
