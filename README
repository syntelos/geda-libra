TODO

    sch

        Fix pin iteration, see test/schematic..sch

        Fix layout "finish stage" for clearance within layout space.

        Differentiate symbols on having pins or not.  Symbols without pins are logo/graphics.

        Place nets: typed, oriented, and positioned for their respective pins.

        Read an existing file and preserve "extra" information.
