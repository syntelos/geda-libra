    general

        Currently the defined work flow is always from tables because
        classes like Pin and Symbol have been implemented with
        independent producer and consumer modes or methods of
        operation.  This situation is far from ideal for a tool set.
        The repair involves merging attribute subclass children of
        Symbol (Pin) and Schematic (Component) into the Attribute
        "children" list for uniformity under producer and consumer
        modes of operation.
