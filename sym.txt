Usage

    Sym -i symbol.csv [options]

Description

    Produce gEDA symbol from pin description table.

  Input table

    The input argument is a CSV file (as from TI), for example
    in the following.

        Part,LM3S9B90,,,
        Package,100LQFP,,,
        Number,Name,Type,Buffer,Description
        1,PE7,I/O,TTL,GPIO port E bit 7.
        1,AIN0,I,Analog,Analog-to-digital converter input 0.
        1,C2o,O,TTL,Analog comparator 2 output.

    This program only employs the first three columns: Number, 
    Name and Type.  This program ignores lines or pin numbers 
    starting with '#'.

    The input CSV should be expanded with metadata, as in the
    following example.  This is required for '-s' output.

        Part,LM3S9B90,,,
        Package,100LQFP,,,
        Layout,lbrt:25/25/25/25,,,
        Description,Stellaris ARM Cortex-M3,,,
        Documentation,http://www.ti.com/lit/gpn/lm3s9b90,,,
        Author,John Pritchard <jdp@ulsf.net>,,,
        License,GPL,,,
        Footprint,LQFP100_14,,,
        Number,Name,Type,Buffer,Description
        1,PE7,I/O,TTL,GPIO port E bit 7.
        1,AIN0,I,Analog,Analog-to-digital converter input 0.
        1,C2o,O,TTL,Analog comparator 2 output.

    The input CSV pins may be ordered by number, ascending
    from one to N.  Multiple records for each number are
    merged onto one generalized pin for output.

  Meta data

    The first value found is employed.  Additional definitions
    are ignored.  Command line input overrides file input as
    the primary definition.

  Pin types

    Pin types may be gEDA types or TI types.

    The TI types include 'I', 'O', and 'I/O' for Buffer 'TTL'
    or 'Analog', and '-' for Buffer 'Power'.

  Pin layout

    Pin layout is defined in a counter-clockwise sequence
    starting from TOP, LEFT, BOTTOM or RIGHT sides via the
    case insensitive acronym TLBR, LBRT, BRTL, and RTLB.

    Pin layout is further described in a number of pins 
    per side, as in the following example.

        lbrt:25/25/25/25

Options

  Output

    When both outputs are employed, tragesym is not run.

    -t symbol.src   Write "tragesym source" output to file; then
                    try running 'tragesym symbol.src symbol.sym'.

    -s symbol.sym   Write gEDA symbol output to file.  Requires
                    full metadata in expanded CSV format.

  Meta

    This info replaces that from the input CSV file.

    -r o:l/b/r/t    Number of pins on each side in CCW order, o:
                    lbrt, brtl, rtlb, tlbr.

    -d 'desc'       Description string.

    -u 'url'        Documentation URL string.

    -a author       Author string.

    -l lic          Distribution and use license name.

Bugs

  License

    Incomplete handling of license needs additional use and
    distribution distinction cases.

  Pins

    Polarized pins not implemented for '-s'.
