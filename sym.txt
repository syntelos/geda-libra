Usage

    sym -i symbol.csv [options]

Description

    Produce gEDA symbol from pin description table.

  Input table

    The input argument is a CSV file (as from TI), for example
    in the following.

        Part,LM3S9B90,,,
        Package,100LQFP,,,
        Number,Name,Type,Buffer,Description
        1,PE7,I/O,TTL,GPIO port E bit 7.
        1,AIN0,I,Analog,Analog-to-digital converter input 0.
        1,C2o,O,TTL,Analog comparator 2 output.

    The input CSV is expanded with metadata, as in the
    following example.

        Part,LM3S9B90,,,
        Package,100LQFP,,,
        Layout,lbrt:25/25/25/25,,,
        Description,Stellaris ARM Cortex-M3,,,
        Documentation,http://www.ti.com/lit/gpn/lm3s9b90,,,
        Author,John Pritchard <jdp@ulsf.net>,,,
        License,GPL,,,
        Footprint,LQFP100_14,,,
        Number,Name,Type,Buffer,Description
        1,PE7,I/O,TTL,GPIO port E bit 7.
        1,AIN0,I,Analog,Analog-to-digital converter input 0.
        1,C2o,O,TTL,Analog comparator 2 output.

    The input CSV pins may be ordered by number, ascending
    from one to N.  Multiple records for each number are
    merged onto one generalized pin for output.

    This program only employs the first three columns: Number, 
    Name and Type.  This program ignores lines or pin numbers 
    starting with '#'.

  Meta data

    The first value found is employed.  Additional definitions
    are ignored.  Command line input overrides file input as
    the primary definition.

  Pin types

    Pin types may be gEDA types or TI types.

    The TI types include 'I', 'O', and 'I/O' for Buffer 'TTL'
    or 'Analog', and '-' for Buffer 'Power'.

  Pin layout

    Pin layout is defined in a counter-clockwise sequence
    starting from TOP, LEFT, BOTTOM or RIGHT sides via the
    case insensitive acronym TLBR, LBRT, BRTL, and RTLB.

    Pin layout is further described in a number of pins 
    per side, as in the following example.

        lbrt:25/25/25/25

Options

  Output

    -s symbol.sym   Write gEDA symbol output to file.  Requires
                    full metadata in expanded CSV format.

Bugs

  Path

    Handled as a logo graphic, but not yet as a part outline
    with pin layout on a path.

  License

    Incomplete handling of license needs additional use and
    distribution distinction cases.
