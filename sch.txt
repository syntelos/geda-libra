Overview

    This tool is planned to generate and edit a gEDA GSCHEM schematic
    from a Schematic Table -- connecting nets to components according
    to the table specification.

    An editing process will be derived from the generation process,
    eventually permitting the preservation of unique information added
    to a generated schematic.

    The editing process will drop nets not defined in the Schematic
    Table.


Schematic Table

    The generation and editing processes are driven by a Schematic
    Table CSV file.

    The CSV file begins with a Meta Data segment, followed by a Table
    Headline and then Table Data.

    Comment rows begin with '#'.

    Meta Data

        The following Meta Data fields may be inserted before the
        Table Headline.  

            Title
            Author
            Logo
            Size

        These are rows inserted before the Table headline with these
        names in the first column and corresponding values in the
        second column of the CSV file.

        The "Logo" is a gEDA/GSCHEM symbol inserted to the right of
        the title near the right margin.  The value is the basic file
        name with dot "sym" extension, but not including any path
        information.

        The "Size" is a letter 'A' - 'Z' identifying an installed
        title block.

    Table Headline

        The column naming is generally as follows.

            Component,Pin,Signal

        A Table Headline is not required.  One headline is permitted
        (and recommended), and is recognized as not Meta Data and
        before Table Data.

        Additional columns are permitted.  They will be ignored by the
        tool.  

    Table Data

        The value of the Component column is a name.  This name is the
        symbol file name without the trailing "dot sym" filename
        extension.

        The value of the Pin column is a Pin Number from within the
        component (symbol).

        The value of the Signal column value is the NET Signal Name.
        The string follows the net naming conventions from gEDA.
