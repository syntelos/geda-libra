Usage

    sch -p symbol [symbol]* [-t schematic.csv]

Description

    Conglomerate a schematic description table from the
    symbols named as arguments to option '-p'.  

    The generated table needs to be edited from multiple to
    single signals per pin, and pin rows deleted for not
    generating 'glue' nets.

    The option '-l' may be employed to identify the 
    directory containing the named symbol source tables.

    The option '-p' may reference a directory, in which case
    all component symbols (not net symbols) found will be 
    employed.  These component symbols must begin with an
    attribute having type 'B', as our symbols generated from
    tables.  Our generated nets begin with attribute type 'P'.

    The option '-t' may reference a directory, in which case
    a schematic file name is generated from symbol names as 
           {t-dir}/schematic[-symbol]+.sch

    The default output target, missing option '-t', is stdout.

  For example

        java -jar sch.jar -p ADXL345 HMC5834 -l test/sym/src \
           -t test/sch/dst/schematic-0.csv

Usage

    sch -i schematic.csv -s schematic.sch

Description

    Generate a gEDA schematic from a schematic description table.

  Input table

    The input argument is a CSV file, for example
    in the following.

        Title,Libra Control
        Author,John Pritchard <jdp@ulsf.net>
        Logo,logo.sym
        Size,D
        Component,Pin,Signal
        ADXL345, 7,SPI_CS_ADXL345
        ADXL345,12,SPI_SDIO
        ADXL345,13,SPI_SDA
        ADXL345,14,SPI_CLK

  Symbol libraries

    The named components have symbol tables in the lib
    directory.

    gEDA titles and connectors are in the gEDA home
    directory.

Parameters & Options

    -i schematic.csv      Source schematic table for generating
                          schematic file.

    -s schematic.sch      Target schematic file.

    -g /usr/share/gEDA    Installation of gEDA contains 
                          directory 'sym' and friends.

                          This location defaults to
                              /usr/share/gEDA
                          or
                              /usr/local/share/gEDA
                          or may be maintained in an 
                          environment variable named
                              GEDA_HOME

    -l lib                Directory containing symbol
                          tables.  This location defaults
                          to
                              lib

    -n lib                Directory containing net symbol
                          files.  This location defaults
                          to
                              lib

  For example

        java -jar sch.jar -i test/sch/src/schematic-0.csv \
           -l test/sym/src -s test/sch/dst/schematic-0.sch

Bugs

  Lib

    Only accepts one lib dir.

  Edit

    Only operates in generation mode, overwriting all existing.
